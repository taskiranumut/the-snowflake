- **Detailed Booking Records:** Tracks guest numbers, duration of stays, special requests, and breakfast bookings, alongside associated costs.
- **Check-In and Check-Out Management:** Allows the confirmation of payments and the management of guest arrivals and departures directly within the app.
- **Breakfast Option During Check-In:** Guests have the option to add breakfast for their entire stay at the time of check-in.
- **Guest Database:** A database stores detailed guest information such as names, emails, IDs, nationalities, and flags for identification purposes.

- **Sales and Stay Duration Analytics:** Features charts that depict total and additional sales, with a focus on the duration of stays as a metric.

## Usage of Application

- First, the application must be logged in.
- `test@test.com` and `123123123` login information can be used for the first login.
- Afterwards, if desired, a new account can be created from the Users tab. Account information is secured by [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth).
- All accounts view a single data set and manipulate the same data set.
- Since the application is a general admin panel, a user-specific database table is not created.
- Now, can be played with all data freely. Enjoy.

## Installation and Development

To run the application in locale, a database structure must first be created in Supabase. You must create a free account (or login) on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) and create tables according to the [API schema](https://github.com/taskiranumut/the-snowflake/blob/main/src/services/supabase/schema.types.ts). For image storage, areas should be created for profile pictures and containers under [Supabase storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage). Environment variables must be defined in the `.env` file in the project root directory, as in the [example file](https://github.com/taskiranumut/the-snowflake/blob/main/.env.example).

RLS policy configurations must be done for tables and storages, [more information](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

After the database installations are completed, the npm project can be run.

```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```
